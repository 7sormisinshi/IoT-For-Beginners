Besides the convenience and mobility that Cisco IP Communicator offers, there are many other benefits of using this software on your computer. Here are some of them:

- Improved productivity: Cisco IP Communicator allows you to access all the features and functions of a Cisco IP Phone from your PC, such as speed dial, call forward, call transfer, conference, and more. You can also use your mouse and keyboard to control the phone functions, making it easier and faster to dial numbers, enter names, and navigate menus.

- Enhanced collaboration: Cisco IP Communicator enables you to communicate with your colleagues and customers using voice and video calls. You can also use Cisco IP Communicator to join audio, web, and video conferences hosted by Cisco Unified MeetingPlace or Cisco WebExÂ® Meeting Center.

You can also use Cisco IP Communicator to connect to your office extension from anywhere with an Internet connection, eliminating the need for a separate phone line or device.

You can also use Cisco IP Communicator with Cisco Security Agent to protect your PC from malicious attacks.

Cisco IP Communicator has a distinct advantage in the IP telephony applications space over competing systems because of the robustness of the Cisco Technology Developer ecosystem. Because Cisco has the largest installed base of IP phones of any competitor and holds the largest share of the market, more than 300 Cisco Technology Developer partners are actively developing applications[^2^]. This is due also, in part, to the long-term Cisco commitment to maintaining Extensible Markup Language (XML) as an open standard and the companyâs development of an open interface. Besides XML, Cisco IP Communications applications are also based on other industry standards such as the Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI) and Java TAPI (JTAPI). Cisco also has created a wealth of resources such as programming guides, FAQ libraries, discussion forums, software development kits, and a robust developer support program. All these resources have made it easier for IP Communications applications developers to build applications for Cisco CallManager and Cisco CallManager Express, which provide customers with many more off-the-shelf applications than are available with any other competitor.
