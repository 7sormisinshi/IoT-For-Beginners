The Deco Ls1600u is a digital satellite receiver that was popular in Brazil and other countries where satellite TV is common. It was able to decode channels encrypted with Nagra 2, but since the satellite providers switched to Nagra 3, the Deco Ls1600u stopped working. However, there is a way to update your Deco Ls1600u to work with Nagra 3, using a device called a dongle.

A dongle is a small device that connects to your Deco Ls1600u via the rs232 port on the back. The dongle is pre-programmed to tune into a certain frequency of a satellite that broadcasts the keys needed to decrypt Nagra 3 channels. The dongle then sends the keys to your Deco Ls1600u, which can then decode the channels you want to watch.
 
To update your Deco Ls1600u to work with Nagra 3, you will need the following:
 
- A Deco Ls1600u with the latest firmware (January 2021)
- A dongle compatible with the Twin protocol (such as Ibox or Azbox)
- A satellite dish pointed to the satellite that broadcasts the keys (such as Amazonas or Hispasat)
- A cable to connect the dongle to your Deco Ls1600u

Once you have all these items, you can follow these steps:

1. Connect the dongle to your satellite dish and power it on.
2. Connect the cable from the dongle to the rs232 port of your Deco Ls1600u.
3. Turn on your Deco Ls1600u and go to Menu > System Setup > Twin Protocol.
4. Enable the Twin Protocol and select the appropriate baud rate for your dongle (usually 9600).
5. Exit the menu and scan for channels. You should be able to receive Nagra 3 channels now.

Congratulations! You have successfully updated your Deco Ls1600u to work with Nagra 3. Enjoy watching your favorite channels!

Nagra 3 is the latest encryption system used by satellite TV providers to protect their content from unauthorized access. Nagra 3 has several advantages over Nagra 2, such as:

- It is more secure and complex, making it harder to crack or predict the keys.
- It supports high definition channels and interactive services.
- It allows for more flexible and dynamic management of channels and packages.
- It reduces piracy and ensures fair revenue for the content providers.

Nagra 3 is also compatible with older Nagra systems, so you can still watch some channels that are encrypted with Nagra 2 using your Deco Ls1600u. However, most of the premium and popular channels have switched to Nagra 3, so you will need a dongle to access them.
 
If you have any questions or problems with your Deco Ls1600u or your dongle, you can contact the customer service of your provider or visit their website for more information. You can also check online forums and blogs for tips and tricks from other users who have updated their Deco Ls1600u to work with Nagra 3.

Nagra 3 is not without its disadvantages, however. Some of the drawbacks of Nagra 3 are:

- It requires more expensive and sophisticated equipment to decode, such as dongles or smart cards.
- It is more vulnerable to signal interference and loss, which can affect the quality and availability of channels.
- It is more difficult to update and maintain, as the keys change frequently and unpredictably.
- It is more prone to legal and ethical issues, as it may violate the rights and interests of content creators, distributors and consumers.

Nagra 3 is a complex and controversial encryption system that has both benefits and drawbacks for satellite TV users. Depending on your preferences, budget and location, you may find Nagra 3 to be a blessing or a curse. In any case, you should always respect the laws and regulations of your country and the terms and conditions of your provider when using Nagra 3.
